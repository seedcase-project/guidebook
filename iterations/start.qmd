# Start of an iteration

{{< include _preamble.qmd >}}

An iteration starts with a planning meeting at the start of each month.
It should ideally be between 30-45 minutes. You as the team lead should
already have prepared for and made a general plan for the iteration, so
this meeting should not be used as a way for everyone to write out and
list all the tasks needed. Rather, the main purpose of this meeting is
to get everyone aligned on the aim and overall plan.

This meeting should ideally *not* be held the same day as the previous
iteration's debrief and retrospective meeting. Two intense meetings in a
row tend to tire most humans out, and being tired is counterproductive
for an effective meeting.

A basic agenda could be:

-   Review and agree on the iteration aims and end date.
-   Review the longer-term roadmap
-   Review the list of tasks on the project board for this iteration.
-   Brainstorm and add any other issues as needed.

### Before meeting

In general, only you as the team lead are required to prepare for the
planning meeting. Before the planning meeting, you need to refine (or
create) the iteration aim and move any existing tasks (GitHub Issues)
into the iteration that are relevant to the aim of the iteration. An
iteration aim should be something that is achievable within the
iteration timeframe. The aim can also include several smaller aims. 

You will also create any issues that are missing from the current list
of issues. While making issues, keep them as small as is reasonable and
as descriptive and targeted as possible.

Other team members can optionally review the aim and output of the
iteration board, review the list of issues already listed, and write out
any potential issues as needed to complete the iteration aim.

### During meeting

During the meeting, someone will share their screen (if virtual) and the
team will go through the tasks on the board together. Everyone will
discuss and decide or agree on the iteration aim(s) (the "increment" or
"milestone").

Then, everyone will briefly review the current list of tasks on the
board and brainstorm any other tasks that are needed. You'll all then
agree on the number of tasks in the iteration as well as the
distribution of priority labels of the tasks.
