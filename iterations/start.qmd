# Start of an iteration

{{< include _preamble.qmd >}}

An iteration starts with a planning meeting at the start of each month.
It should ideally be between 30-45 minutes. If you are the team lead,
you should already have prepared for and made a general plan for the
iteration, so this meeting should not be used as a way for everyone to
write out and list all the tasks needed. Rather, the main purpose of
this meeting is to get everyone aligned on the aim(s) and overall plan.

This meeting should ideally *not* be held the same day as the previous
iteration's debrief and retrospective meeting. Two intense meetings in a
row tend to tire most humans out, and being tired is counterproductive
for an effective meeting.

A basic agenda could be:

-   Review the longer-term roadmap
-   Review and agree on the iteration aims and end date.
-   Review the list of tasks on the project board for this iteration.
-   Brainstorm and add any other issues as needed.

### Before meeting

In general, if you are not the team lead, you don't really need to
prepare for this meeting. If you are the team lead though, you do need
to prepare. So if you are the team lead:

-   Before the planning meeting you need to refine (or create) the
    iteration aim(s) and move any existing tasks (GitHub Issues) into
    the iteration that are relevant to the aim(s) of the iteration. An
    iteration aim (or aims) should be something that is achievable
    within the iteration timeframe. The iteration should ideally have
    only a few main, larger aims, but can include a few more smaller
    aims.

-   create any issues that are missing from the current list of issues.
    While making issues, keep them as small as is reasonable and as
    descriptive and targeted as possible.

If you are not the team lead, you can optionally review the aim(s) and
output of the iteration board, review the list of issues already listed,
and write out any potential issues as needed to complete the iteration
aim.

### During meeting

During the meeting, someone will share their screen (if virtual) and the
team will go through the tasks on the board together. Ideally, the team
lead would be the one faciliatating the meeting, but it can be anyone.

You all will go over the roadmap or the longer term plan, to keep
everyone aligned and updated. Then, you all will discuss and decide or
agree on the iteration aim(s) (the "increment" or "milestone").

Finally, everyone will briefly review the current list of tasks on the
board and brainstorm any other tasks that are needed. You'll agree on
the number of tasks in the iteration as well as the distribution of
priority labels of the tasks.

After that, you're done! Remember, this meeting is not meant to take up
too much time.
