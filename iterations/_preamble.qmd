::: callout-tip
- It's good practice to assign a timekeeper to keep us on track and so
  we avoid spending too long on any one topic.
- While this guide can apply to all members of the team, several parts
  of it are specific to the team lead. Those parts will be explicitly
  marked to indicate that they are only for the team lead.
