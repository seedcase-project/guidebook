::: callout-tip
-   It's good practice to assign a timekeeper to keep us on track and so
    we avoid spending too long on any one topic.
-   While this guide can apply to all members of the team, several parts
    of it are specific to the team lead. Those parts will be explicitly
    marked to indicate that they are only for the team lead.
