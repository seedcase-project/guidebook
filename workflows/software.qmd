# Software development

This chapter describes an approach to developing software that we've
found to be effective at helping us build higher-quality, more reliable,
and maintainable software products that get built faster and have less
issues over time. It combines and mixes several development methods and
best practices, starting from a high-level by following an [iterative
and incremental
development](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-kanban-and-iid)
approach with aspects of Kanban for project planning and management,
including regular update and reflection meetings (called
retrospectives). Within a given product, the workflow includes:
<!-- TODO: Eventually replace with links to decision posts -->

-   [Continuous
    integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
    (that includes automated testing and checking) through trunk-based
    development (with short-lived branches following the [GitHub
    Flow](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-github-flow/))
-   [Continuous
    delivery/deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery)
-   [Test-driven
    development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
-   [Domain-driven
    design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)
-   [Documentation-driven
    development](https://gist.github.com/zsup/9434452) (using
    [Diataxis](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-diataxis)
    framework to structure the documentation)

These practices and workflows are also described in many software
development books and resources, such as:

-   [Philosophy of Software
    Design](https://books.google.dk/books/about/A_Philosophy_of_Software_Design.html?id=hkfEzgEACAAJ&redir_esc=y)
-   [Domain Modeling Made Functional: Tackle Software Complexity with
    Domain-Driven Design and
    F#](https://pragprog.com/titles/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional/)
-   [Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and
    Scaling High Performing Technology
    Organizations](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339)
-   [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/)

So, how do you integrate all of these together when developing software?
That's what this section is all about! :tada:

## Visual overview

The following diagram gives a visual overview of the stages of
development and how they connect. We'll cover each part in more detail
in the following sections.

Rounded boxes represent stages and methods of development, while indented rectangled boxes represent the output of those stages as documentation types. Rectangle boxes represent generic activities that integrate many stages together."

```

Underlying all of this is an iterative and incremental development
approach (described in more detail in @sec-iterations), continuously
integrating the changes, and continuously deploying the software and
associated documentation (as a website).
