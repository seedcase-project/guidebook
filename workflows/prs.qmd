# Pull requests

Pull requests (PRs) are how we propose, review, and discuss changes
before they become part of a project on GitHub. This section covers the
practices we follow for creating and reviewing pull requests.

## What is a pull request?

To understand pull requests, it helps to first understand *branches*.
When you work on a project in Git, there is a default branch (usually
called `main`) that holds the current, stable version of the project.
Instead of making changes directly to `main`, you create a *branch* —
think of it like making a copy of a document so you can draft changes
without touching the original. You work on your branch independently,
and when you are happy with your changes, you propose merging them back
into `main`. That proposal is called a **pull request** (PR).

A PR gives your collaborators the opportunity to review your changes,
ask questions, and suggest improvements before the changes become part
of the project. This review process helps catch mistakes, maintain
quality, and keep your collaborators informed about what is changing and
why.

The diagram below shows this in practice. A person creates a branch
called `docs/add-pr-guide` to work on their changes. The dots represent
[commits](commits.qmd) — saved snapshots of their work. When ready, they
open a PR. After review and approval, their changes are merged back into
the `main` branch of the project.

    branch docs/add-pr-guide
    checkout docs/add-pr-guide
    commit
    commit
    commit tag:"Make PR"
    checkout main
    merge docs/add-pr-guide
    commit
```

Generally, the PR process follows these steps:

-   Create a branch for your changes.
-   Make your changes and commit them to the branch.
-   Open a pull request on GitHub to propose merging your changes into
    `main`.
-   Review and discuss the changes with your collaborators.
-   If the changes are approved, merge the PR into `main`. If not, make
    further changes, update the PR, and request another review.

## Creating a pull request

### When to create a PR

Create a pull request when you have a set of changes that are ready for
someone else to review. This usually means after you have completed the
work on an issue or task, and the changes are in a state where they can
be tested and reviewed.

### Keep PRs small

Each pull request should represent a single, focused change. This makes
it easier for reviewers to understand the changes and provide meaningful
feedback. A small (*atomic*) PR might be:

-   Adding a new section to a document.
-   Fixing a bug or typo.
-   Refactoring a specific component or function.
-   Adding or updating a single feature.

Avoid combining unrelated changes into a single PR. If you find yourself
writing "and" in your PR description to connect two separate ideas,
consider splitting them into separate PRs. Smaller, focused PRs are
quicker to review, easier to test, and simpler to revert if something
goes wrong.

### Branch naming conventions

Branch names should be lowercase, use hyphens between words, and follow
the format `{type}/{short-description}`. The `type` is based on the
[Conventional Commits](commits.qmd#conventional-commits) types (e.g.,
`docs`, `fix`, `feat`, `refactor`). For example:

-   `docs/add-pr-workflow-guide`
-   `fix/broken-link-in-readme`
-   `refactor/update-template-structure`

### Writing a good PR description

A good PR description helps reviewers understand the context and purpose
of the changes. Our repositories include a [pull request
template](https://github.com/seedcase-project/guidebook/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md)
to make it easy to fill out the description when creating a PR. In the
description field, aim to cover:

-   **What** was changed: Briefly describe the changes you made.
-   **Why** it was changed: Explain the motivation or reasoning behind
    the changes.
-   **How** it was changed: If the changes are not straightforward,
    describe the approach you took.

If the PR addresses an existing issue, reference it by writing
`Closes #<issue-number>` in the description. This automatically links
the PR to the issue and closes the issue when the PR is merged.

Try to keep the description **concise but informative**. A few sentences
that give enough context for someone unfamiliar with the work to
understand what you did and why is a good target. The easier it is for a
reviewer to understand the PR, the faster and more focused their
feedback will be.

Indicate in the description whether the PR needs a quick or thorough
review. A quick review might be suitable for small changes like typos,
while a thorough review is better for larger or more complex changes.

### Assigning assignees and reviewers

When you create a PR, you should assign an assignee and request
reviewers using the options in the sidebar on the right side of the PR
page on GitHub:

-   **Assignees**: Assign yourself to the PR. This tells others that you
    are the person responsible for the changes and for addressing any
    feedback.
-   **Reviewers**: Request a review from one or more collaborators. This
    notifies them that the PR is ready for their feedback.

Setting both ensures that it is clear who owns the PR and who needs to
look at it.

## Reviewing a pull request

Reviewing pull requests is a key part of a collaborative workflow. As
outlined in our [task priority order](../iterations/during.qmd), both
responding to reviewer comments on your own PRs and reviewing others'
PRs are high priority tasks. Timely reviews keep the work moving and
prevent bottlenecks.

### Making suggestions

When reviewing a PR, focus on providing constructive and actionable
feedback. Use GitHub's suggestion feature to propose specific changes
directly in the code or text. This makes it easy for the author to
accept your changes with a single click.

To make a suggestion, go to the "Files changed" tab and click the `+`
icon next to a line. Then, either add a comment or make a suggestion. If
you want to make a specific suggestion, click the "Add a suggestion"
button (a document icon with `+` and `-`). This inserts the suggestion
syntax into the comment box, where you can write your proposed change.
The syntax looks like this:

```` text
```suggestion
the corrected or improved text here
```
````

When leaving comments, be specific about what you think should change
and why. Avoid vague feedback like "this doesn't look right" and instead
explain what the issue is and how it could be improved.

### Comment, request changes, or approve

When you finish your review, GitHub gives you three options for
submitting it:

-   **Comment**: General feedback or questions that don't block merging.
    Good for minor suggestions the author can choose to address.
-   **Request changes**: Issues that must be resolved before merging.
    This signals that further work is needed and prevents accidental
    merging.
-   **Approve**: The changes are approved and ready to be merged.

If a reviewer requests changes, address the feedback, update the PR, and
re-request a review, by clicking the "Re-request review" button in the
right sidebar of the PR page. This continues until the PR is approved
and ready to merge.

## Merging a pull request

Once a PR is approved, it can be merged into `main`. GitHub offers
several merge strategies (e.g., "Merge commit", "Squash and merge",
"Rebase and merge"). We typically use **"Squash and merge"**, which
combines all the commits in the PR into a single commit on `main`. This
keeps the commit history clean and focused on the overall change rather
than individual commits.
