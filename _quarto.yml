    This guidebook is written following the [diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/) "how-to guide" style.
    And because this document reflects how we work in the [Seedcase Project](https://seedcase-project.org/),
    it is living and constantly evolving. It won't ever be in a state of "done".
