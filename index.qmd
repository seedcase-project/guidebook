# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

::: callout-caution
These documents are very much a work in progress and very much
incomplete. We work on it slowly and when we can.
:::

This guidebook walks you through how we, in the [Seedcase Project](https://seedcase-project.org/), develop and release research
software, build data infrastructures, create content on websites, and
work together as a team. We've written this to collect best practices
and lessons learned as we've built products as a team.

We cover topics that range from our contribution workflow,
how we write code, how we ensure our products are secure and
reliable, how we collaborate and manage our work, and more.

## Who you are as the reader

We've written these documents considering a few people in mind who we
think will read the documents:

-   **New contributors/team members**: This is who we are primarily
    writing for. If you are new to working with us on the Seedcase
    Project, these documents are designed with you in mind.
-   **Research software/data engineers**: If you work in another
    organization or group, we write these documents to share our
    practices with you. You can use this either as a guide or as a
    reference to help you improve and learn how we work.
-   **Managers or leaders**: If you are in a position where you have
    control or power to influence how work is done and organised, these
    documents can serve as inspiration for how to structure teams,
    workflows, and practices to build products more effectively,
    reliably, and securely.
-   **Research or development operations personnel**: For those who are
    responsible for maintaining infrastructure or operational aspects of
    a research organisation, these documents can provide insights into
    best practices for managing and deploying research software and data
    systems in an effective way that hopefully reduces your workload.
